* it was kind of unclear from the question which side is the "receiving side". I assumed it was the server 
when a request is sent, the site's dns server (ie dns.jct.ac.il) searches for the query.
for example if we'll request the subdomain moodle.jct.ac.il the dns server will check all 
entries and if the subdomain exists the ip address for the appropriate subdomain will be sent 
over. if the dns server can't find a name matching the subdomain, it implies the subdomain 
doesn't exist on the relevant dns server we are checking (ie dns.jct.ac.il).
